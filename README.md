This extension exports annotations from current PDF (or current item's PDF attachment) as a .org file. Each annotation is reproduced as a `quote` block with an [org-pdftools](https://github.com/fuxialexander/org-pdftools) style pdf link to the correct page of the file's local location in the Zotero database.  

The final implementation should include tests, build instructions, installation and usage instructions, as well as the main code.
